# Spacing Fix Summary

## Problem
The equation `\sin{a}\cos{b}=\frac{1}{2}[\sin{(a+b)}+\sin{(a-b)}]` was producing output with spacing issues.

## Root Causes Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Trailing Spaces After Superscripts/Subscripts/Fractions**
   - **Issue**: Every superscript, subscript, and fraction was adding a trailing space
   - **Location**: `js/ast-printer.js` lines 94-95, 125-127, 132-134, 139-141, 151-153, 167
   - **Fix**: Removed all trailing spaces from these constructs
   - **Rationale**: Spaces should only be added between adjacent letters, not automatically after every script or fraction

### 2. **Trig Function Argument Handling**
   - **Issue**: Trig function arguments were wrapped in lenticular brackets `〖〗` which created visual separation
   - **Previous**: `sin〖a〗 cos〖b〗`
   - **Fixed**: `sin⁡a cos⁡b` (using function application character U+2061)
   - **Location**: `js/ast-printer.js` lines 62-70
   - **Rationale**: The function application character (⁡) is the proper way to indicate function application in UnicodeMath

### 3. **Square Bracket Parsing**
   - **Issue**: Square brackets `[` and `]` were being ignored by the parser
   - **Location**: `js/latex-parser.js` - missing handlers for `[` and `]`
   - **Fix**: Added explicit handling to return them as text nodes
   - **Lines added**: 293-301 in `js/latex-parser.js`

### 4. **Double Space Removal in Post-Processing**
   - **Issue**: Even with the above fixes, some double spaces could still occur
   - **Location**: `js/postprocessor.js`
   - **Fix**: Added a rule to remove all instances of multiple consecutive spaces
   - **Pattern**: `/  +/g` → `' '`

## Files Modified

1. **js/ast-printer.js**
   - Removed trailing spaces after subscripts, superscripts, and fractions
   - Changed trig function argument handling to use function application character (⁡)
   - Cleaned up debug logging

2. **js/latex-parser.js**
   - Added explicit handling for square brackets `[` and `]` as text nodes

3. **js/postprocessor.js**
   - Added double-space removal rule as first post-processing step

4. **js/latex-converter.js**
   - Removed debug console.log statements

## Expected Output

**Input**: `\sin{a}\cos{b}=\frac{1}{2}[\sin{(a+b)}+\sin{(a-b)}]`

**Output**: `sin⁡a cos⁡b=(1)/(2)[sin⁡(a+b)+sin⁡(a-b)]`

Where `⁡` is the invisible function application character (U+2061).

## Key Principles Applied

1. **Minimal Spacing**: Don't add spaces preemptively; only add them where needed (between adjacent letters)
2. **Use Proper Unicode Characters**: Function application character (U+2061) for function-argument relationships
3. **Defensive Post-Processing**: Clean up any double spaces that might slip through
4. **Complete Parsing**: Ensure all LaTeX constructs (including brackets) are properly parsed
