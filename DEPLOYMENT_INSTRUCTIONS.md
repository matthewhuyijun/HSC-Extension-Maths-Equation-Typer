## 🚀 Next Steps - Push to GitHub

Due to current network connectivity issues, the changes are committed locally but not yet pushed. When you have stable network access, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Push LaTeXLive Submodule Changes

```bash
cd /Users/matthew/Desktop/HSC-Extension-Maths-Equation-Typer-main/LaTeXLive
git push origin main
```

This will push the attribution updates to https://github.com/matthewhuyijun/LaTeXLive

### Step 2: Push Main Repository Changes

```bash
cd /Users/matthew/Desktop/HSC-Extension-Maths-Equation-Typer-main
git push origin main
```

This will push everything to https://github.com/matthewhuyijun/HSC-Extension-Maths-Equation-Typer

## 🔧 Enable GitHub Pages

After pushing, you need to enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings:

1. Go to https://github.com/matthewhuyijun/HSC-Extension-Maths-Equation-Typer/settings/pages

2. Under **"Source"**, select:
   - Source: **GitHub Actions** (not "Deploy from a branch")

3. Save the settings

4. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically run and deploy your site

5. Your site will be available at:
   **https://matthewhuyijun.github.io/HSC-Extension-Maths-Equation-Typer/**

## 📋 What Will Happen After Push

### Immediate Effects:
1. ✅ Attribution to original LaTeXLive project will be visible on GitHub
2. ✅ README documentation will display on your repository page
3. ✅ GitHub Actions workflow will automatically trigger

### GitHub Actions Will:
1. Check out your code (including LaTeXLive submodule)
2. Build and package your site
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages
4. Make your site live at the URL above

### On Your Live Site:
- `index.html` (your main E2 MathsTyper) will be the homepage
- LaTeXLive editor will be accessible at `/LaTeXLive/`
- All attribution will be properly documented

## 🔍 Verify Deployment

After pushing and enabling Pages:

1. Check Actions tab: https://github.com/matthewhuyijun/HSC-Extension-Maths-Equation-Typer/actions
2. Wait for the workflow to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)
3. Visit your live site: https://matthewhuyijun.github.io/HSC-Extension-Maths-Equation-Typer/

## 📝 Attribution Summary

Your project now properly credits:

### Original LaTeXLive Project:
- **Authors**: QianJianTech, yuetao1011
- **License**: Apache 2.0
- **Repository**: https://github.com/QianJianTech/LaTeXLive

### Your Modifications:
- **Author**: Matthew Hu
- **Year**: 2025
- **Changes**: 
  - Removed authentication system
  - Removed picture recognition
  - Enhanced dark mode
  - Performance optimizations
  - GitHub Pages deployment

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### If Push Fails:
- Check SSH key access: `ssh -T git@github.com`
- Or use HTTPS temporarily (will prompt for credentials)

### If Pages Don't Deploy:
- Verify "GitHub Actions" is selected as the source
- Check Actions tab for error messages
- Ensure repository is public (or Pages is enabled for private repos)

### If Submodule Doesn't Load:
- The submodule should automatically be included by the workflow
- If issues persist, check the submodule URL in `.gitmodules`

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Everything is committed and ready to push. Just run the commands above when you have network access, enable GitHub Pages, and your properly attributed E2 MathsTyper will be live!

For any questions or issues, check the Actions logs on GitHub or review this document.
