# ✅ Debugging Complete: Sin Cos Spacing Issues Fixed

## Problem Statement
The equation `\sin{a}\cos{b}=\frac{1}{2}[\sin{(a+b)}+\sin{(a-b)}]` was producing incorrect spacing in the Word equation output.

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. **Trailing Spaces After Math Constructs** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Problem**: Every superscript, subscript, and fraction was adding an automatic trailing space.

**Example**:
- `x^2` was outputting `x^(2) ` (note the trailing space)
- `\frac{1}{2}` was outputting `(1)/(2) ` (note the trailing space)

**Fix**: Removed all trailing spaces from:
- Superscripts: `'^' + printScriptArg(ast.sup, true) + ' '` → `'^' + printScriptArg(ast.sup, true)`
- Subscripts: `'_' + printScriptArg(ast.sub) + ' '` → `'_' + printScriptArg(ast.sub)`
- Fractions: `` `(${num})/(${den}) ` `` → `` `(${num})/(${den})` ``

### 2. **Incorrect Trig Function Handling** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Problem**: Trig function arguments were wrapped in lenticular brackets `〖〗`, creating visual separation.

**Before**: 
- `\sin{a}` → `sin〖a〗`
- This created unwanted visual separation in Word

**After**:
- `\sin{a}` → `sin⁡a` (using function application character U+2061)
- This is the correct UnicodeMath format

**Fix**: Changed from wrapping in lenticular brackets to using the invisible function application character (⁡ U+2061).

**Files**: `js/ast-printer.js` lines 62-70

### 3. **Missing Square Bracket Parsing** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Problem**: Square brackets `[` and `]` were being completely ignored by the parser!

**Root Cause**: 
- The parser's text consumption regex stopped at brackets: `/[\\{}\[\]_^|\s]/`
- But there was no handler for what to do when a `[` or `]` was encountered
- Result: They were silently dropped from the output

**Fix**: Added explicit handlers:
```javascript
if (ch === '[') {
    consume();
    return { type: 'text', value: '[' };
}

if (ch === ']') {
    consume();
    return { type: 'text', value: ']' };
}
```

### 4. **Double Space Prevention**
**Problem**: Even with the above fixes, edge cases could still produce double spaces.

**Fix**: Added a post-processing rule to remove any multiple consecutive spaces:
```javascript
{
    name: 'remove-double-spaces',
    pattern: /  +/g,
    replace: ' '
}
```

**Files**: `js/postprocessor.js` lines 51-56

## Final Result

### Input
```latex
\sin{a}\cos{b}=\frac{1}{2}[\sin{(a+b)}+\sin{(a-b)}]
```

### Correct Output
```
sin⁡a cos⁡b=(1)/(2)[sin⁡(a+b)+sin⁡(a-b)]
```

Where `⁡` is the invisible function application character (U+2061).

## Key Technical Insights

1. **Spacing Philosophy**: Don't add spaces preemptively. Only add them where needed (between adjacent letters).

2. **Function Application Character**: The proper way to indicate function application in UnicodeMath is with U+2061, not lenticular brackets.

3. **Complete Parsing**: Every character in the input must be handled. Silent drops lead to bugs.

4. **Defensive Post-Processing**: Always have a safety net to clean up edge cases.
