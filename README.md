## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Open** `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
2. **Type** your LaTeX equation in the "Rendered Input" field
3. **Copy** the generated LaTeX or other format using the copy buttons
4. **Paste** the code into **Notion** or other web platforms

## 📝 Platform Compatibility

### ✅ **Notion** - Perfect Match

• LaTeX work excellently in Notion

• Clean, professional rendering

• No compatibility issues

### ⚠️ **Microsoft Word** - Use Native Equation Editor Instead
**Important:** While LaTeX can be used in Word, it's **not recommended** for:

• **Vectors** (complex arrow notation)


• **Complex numbers** (imaginary unit notation)


**Why LaTeX struggles in Word:**
• I've tested multiple approaches: Unicode with regex, AST parsing, and MathML conversion

• All methods failed to render complex mathematical notation properly in Word

• Word's native equation editor handles these cases much better

**Recommendation:** Use Word's **native equation editor** (Insert → Equation) for complex math in Word documents.

**If you must paste into Word:**
• Word ingests **MathML** more reliably than raw LaTeX, so copy MathML (or click the new `Unicode` button which copies MathML automatically) before switching apps.
• On the PluriMath page that opens, choose the **MathML → UnicodeMath** conversion—the MathML is already on your clipboard as soon as you press the button, so you can paste it straight in and grab the Unicode output for Word if needed.
