## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Open** `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
2. **Type** your LaTeX equation in the "Rendered Input" field
3. **Copy** the generated LaTeX or other format using the copy buttons
4. **Paste** the code into **Notion** or other web platforms

## üìù Platform Compatibility

### ‚úÖ **Notion** - Perfect Match

‚Ä¢ LaTeX work excellently in Notion

‚Ä¢ Clean, professional rendering

‚Ä¢ No compatibility issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Microsoft Word** - Use Native Equation Editor Instead
**Important:** While LaTeX can be used in Word, it's **not recommended** for:

‚Ä¢ **Vectors** (complex arrow notation)


‚Ä¢ **Complex numbers** (imaginary unit notation)


**Why LaTeX struggles in Word:**
‚Ä¢ I've tested multiple approaches: Unicode with regex, AST parsing, and MathML conversion

‚Ä¢ All methods failed to render complex mathematical notation properly in Word

‚Ä¢ Word's native equation editor handles these cases much better

**Recommendation:** Use Word's **native equation editor** (Insert ‚Üí Equation) for complex math in Word documents.
