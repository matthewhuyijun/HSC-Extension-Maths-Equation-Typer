## üîß Running Locally

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** This app uses ES6 modules which **do not work** with the `file://` protocol. You **must** serve it through an HTTP server.

### Quick Start:

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open a terminal in the project folder
3. Start a local web server:

   ```bash
   # Using Python 3 (recommended)
   python3 -m http.server 8000

   # Or using Node.js
   npx serve

   # Or using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

4. Open your browser to: `http://localhost:8000/index.html`

### Troubleshooting:

If you see "LaTeX code not converting" or equations appear as raw LaTeX:
- Check browser console (F12) for module loading errors
- Ensure you're accessing via `http://` not `file://`
- The app will show an alert if modules fail to load
